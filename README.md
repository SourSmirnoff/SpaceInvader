The game has a main menu that features a PLAY button, OPTIONS button, and QUIT button.

The options screen only has a toggle for the background music, and a back button.

The game tracks your highscore no matter how you quite and saves it to a simple highscore.txt file.

Free to use, learn from, add to, or anything - obviously.
